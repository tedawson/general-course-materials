#Mapping Project for fourth semester German (Spring 2015)

These are the "Codevorlagen" for working with GeoJSON to make a map of tunnels under the Berlin wall. This was a project for the
fourth semester German class I team taught with Per Urlaub in Spring 2015. Thanks to Per for coming up with the project and Todd Hughes
for providing an English example (code1.js is in part a translation of Todd's example into German).
